    <h1>What can you do?</h1>
  <p class="txtAlign"><mark><b>1. Tell people.</b></mark> One person can make a change, but a crowd WILL make a change. Did you learn something new from this website? Tell people. Do you have an idea you want to implement? Ask people. Spreading the word is one of the easiest ways you can help our planet. If more people know, more people can pitch in. Present to a class of children about the crisis we are in. Inform the more privileged of the injustices lower income communities face from air pollution. Contact fellow nature enthusiants and inform them of the extent to which species are approaching extinction. Tell someone. </p>
    

    <p class="txtAlign"><mark><b>2. Decrease your carbon footprint.</b></mark> Air pollution and a lack of biodiversity correlates with the release of greenhouse gasses and climate change. Implement small changes in your life that make you greener. Throw that piece of trash in the trash can. Bike to work. Recycle when appropriate. Turn off the lights and the heater when not in use. Take shorter showers. Opt for sustainable fashion rather than cheaper fast fashion, which usually ends up in already crowded landfills. Respect the many different habitats you may come across. Opt for solar panels if you can. If we all work to make sustainable changes, we can slow down climate change immensely.</p>

      <p class="txtAlign"><mark><b>3. Plant a garden in your community.</b></mark> Gardens are a goldmine of biodiversity. While it may not seem significant, planting a garden will support the wildlife in your community. For example, the pollen from flowers attracts and nurtures bees, a key aspect of our ecosystem. Additionally, trees absorb carbon dioxide in the air; more trees means a smaller carbon footprint. Be proactive! Rather than simply enjoying nature you see around your block or at work, spread this joy by planting your own. </p>
    

    <p class="txtAlign"><mark><b>4. Attend protests.</b></mark> Protests have historically been effective numerous times. Your voice can make a difference. Go to a peaceful protest, and advocate for a species of animals (or all of them). For example, make a sign about the melting icecaps in Antarctica. Be the voice for those who can't be loud. Fight against the large corporations taking advantage of lower income communities for their own profit by attending protests against them. It's clear there's a problem. You can contribute to fixing it.</p>
